## 1. Executive Summary

**ABCH Ticketing CRM v2** is an internal enterprise ticketing and service-management platform built specifically for hospital operations. It replaces fragmented, manual processes with a structured, real-time, multi-department workflow for tracking, escalating, and resolving service requests across hospital facilities.

**Key capabilities:**

- Fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- SLA enforcement with automated breach alerts
- Real-time updates via WebSockets and browser push notifications
- Arabic/English bilingual interface (RTL-first)
- Knowledge base, asset tracking, team collaboration, and full audit trail

**Delivery:** Single-page React application backed by a Node.js/nest API and PostgreSQL database.

---

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Hospital staff across multiple departments raise service requests (IT, maintenance, medical equipment, facilities, etc.) through fragmented channels — phone calls, WhatsApp, paper forms. This causes:

- No visibility into request status for the requester
- No SLA enforcement or escalation path
- No historical audit trail or accountability
- No analytics to identify recurring issues

### 2.2 Proposed Solution

A centralized, web-based help desk platform where:

- Any staff member can submit a ticket from any device
- Each ticket is routed to the responsible department with a defined SLA
- Department staff manage, respond to, assign, and resolve tickets in real time
- Managers access analytics dashboards and audit logs
- A knowledge base reduces repeat ticket volume

### 2.3 Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|---|---|
| Internal staff ticketing | Patient-facing portals |
| Multi-department routing | External vendor integrations |
| SLA monitoring & alerts | Native mobile apps |
| Real-time per-ticket messaging | Email ticketing ingestion |
| Knowledge base (AR/EN) | Advanced AI/ML triage |
| Asset tracking | Financial or billing systems |
| Team feed / collaboration | HR or payroll integration |
| Audit logging | |
| Browser push notifications | |
| Data export (CSV/Excel) | |

---

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

## 4. User Roles & Personas

### 4.1 Role Hierarchy

```
super_admin
  └── admin
        └── dept_manager
              └── agent
                    └── end_user
```

### 4.2 Persona Definitions

| Role | Who They Are | Primary Actions |
|---|---|---|
| **end_user** | General hospital staff (nurse, clerk, etc.) | Submit tickets, track own tickets, rate resolutions |
| **agent** | Department technician / specialist | View inbox, respond to tickets, update status, add notes |
| **dept_manager** | Head of a department | All agent actions + assign/transfer tickets, view dept analytics, manage team feed |

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Authentication & Session Management

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| AUTH-01 | Users authenticate with `badgeNumber` + password |
| AUTH-02 | JWT-based auth: short-lived access token (15 min) + long-lived refresh token (7 days) stored in an HTTP-only cookie |
| AUTH-03 | Refresh token is rotated on every use |
| AUTH-04 | `forcePasswordChange` flag forces a password reset on next login |
| AUTH-05 | Login endpoint is rate-limited to prevent brute force (5 attempts / 15 min) |
| AUTH-06 | Logout invalidates the refresh token server-side |
| AUTH-07 | Last login timestamp and IP address are recorded per user |
| AUTH-08 | Language preference (`ar` / `en`) is persisted per user profile |

### 5.2 Ticket Lifecycle

#### 5.2.1 Ticket Creation

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| TKT-01 | Any authenticated user with `canSendTickets` permission can create a ticket |
| TKT-02 | A unique, human-readable ticket number is auto-generated (department prefix + sequence) |
| TKT-03 | Required fields: `description`, `departmentId` (target department) |
| TKT-04 | Optional fields: subject, ticket type, priority, building, floor, room extension, related tickets, asset, due date |
| TKT-05 | SLA deadline is automatically calculated from the department or ticket-type SLA hours at creation time |
| TKT-06 | Creator's name, phone, extension, and department are snapshotted (denormalized) at creation time |
| TKT-07 | File attachments (images, documents, voice notes) may be added at creation or at any later point |

#### 5.2.2 Ticket Status Flow

The system defines **three core operational states**. `closed` is a voluntary requester confirmation and carries no KPI weight.

```

   RESOLVED ──────────────────────────────────┘
       │
       │ Requester confirms (optional)
       ▼
   CLOSED  (voluntary — no KPI impact)
```

| Status | Actor | KPI Impact | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pending` | — | ⏸ Not started | Ticket created by requester; awaiting department pickup |
| `open` | Agent / Dept | ▶ SLA + Agent KPI **start** | Department acknowledges and begins work; SLA clock starts |
| `resolved` | Agent | ⏹ SLA + Agent KPI **locked** | Agent marks issue resolved; push notification sent to requester |
| `closed` | Requester *(optional)* | ✅ No KPI impact | Requester voluntarily confirms resolution and optionally leaves a rating (1–5) + feedback |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`in_progress` and `on_hold` are NOT standalone statuses.** External resource requirements are captured via the `requiresExternalResource` flag + `externalResourceNote` + `externalResourceCost` fields and do **not** affect the core status flow.

#### 5.2.3 KPI & SLA Measurement Points

| Metric | Start Event | End Event | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SLA (Department)** | Ticket moves to `open` | Ticket moves to `resolved` | Configured in hours per department or ticket type |
| **First Response Time** | Ticket moves to `open` | First agent message sent (`firstResponseAt`) | Stamped automatically on first message |
| **Resolution Time (Agent KPI)** | Ticket moves to `open` | Ticket moves to `resolved` (`completedAt`) | Used for agent performance analytics |
| **Requester Satisfaction** | Ticket moves to `resolved` | Requester submits rating | Optional; stored as `rating` + `feedback` on ticket |

#### 5.2.4 Ticket Operations

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| TKT-10 | Agent moves ticket `pending` → `open` to acknowledge it; SLA timer starts at this exact timestamp |
| TKT-11 | Agent moves ticket `open` → `resolved`; `completedAt` is stamped, KPI is locked, and a push notification is sent to the requester |
| TKT-12 | Requester may move ticket `resolved` → `closed` (confirmation + optional rating); voluntary with no time limit |
| TKT-13 | Requester may reopen a `resolved` ticket, returning it to `pending`; a new SLA cycle begins when the target dept moves it to `open` |
| TKT-14 | Agents can assign or reassign tickets to department members while the ticket is `open` |
| TKT-15 | Transfers are governed by `DeptTransferAllowlist`; only permitted source→target pairs are valid; a transfer reason is required |
| TKT-16 | On transfer, the ticket returns to `pending` in the target department; a new SLA cycle starts when that department moves it to `open` |
| TKT-17 | Full status history is maintained per ticket (`TicketStatusHistory`) |
| TKT-18 | `firstResponseAt` is stamped on the first agent message after the ticket reaches `open` |
| TKT-19 | Archived tickets are soft-deleted from active views but remain searchable |
| TKT-20 | External resource requirements are captured via `requiresExternalResource`, `externalResourceCost`, and `externalResourceNote` flags — they do **not** change ticket status |
| TKT-21 | Tickets can be linked to a hospital asset via `assetId` |

## 9. Constraints & Assumptions

### 9.1 Constraints

- **Internal only**: Exclusively for authenticated hospital staff; no public-facing access.
- **Hospital network**: Deployed on-premises or in a private cloud within the hospital network perimeter.
- **Browser-based**: No native mobile app in v2; push notifications delivered via Web Push PWA.
- **Arabic-first**: UI defaults to Arabic RTL; all user-facing strings must have Arabic translations.
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Data layer is tightly coupled to PostgreSQL; no multi-database support required.

### 9.2 Assumptions

- Each user belongs to exactly one department (except `super_admin`, who has no department).
- Ticket numbers are unique and human-readable (department prefix + sequence, not raw UUIDs).
- SLA deadlines use calendar hours, not business hours (business-hours SLA is a v3 enhancement).
- File uploads are stored on local disk (`/uploads`); cloud storage migration is a v3 concern.
- Email notifications are out of scope for v2 (Web Push only).
- Redis is available in the deployment environment.
